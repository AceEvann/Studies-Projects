# Capitalized Name

### Create a prompt that asks the user for their name, but if they give you a name that is uppercase or lowercase, it has to be able to send them an alert that says "Hello, " and then their name capitalized, where only the first character has to be capitalized while the rest of the characters has to be in lowercase.

# Tweet Char Count Limiter

### 1 - Write some JavaScript code in order to create a prompt where the user can enter a long string, such as a paragraph of text from a blog post, and you will tell them how many characters they have written and also how many characters they have remaining out of either 140 or 280 characters. The output that you should get should be something like:

- *"You have written 182 characters, you have -42 characters left".*

### 2 - Write some code that creates a prompt, and when you paste in a large paragraph of text, then it should give you an alert that cuts your tweet down to only 140 characters.

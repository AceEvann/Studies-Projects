# Tweet Char Count Limiter

### 1 - Write a code in order to create a prompt where the user can enter a long string, such as a paragraph of text from a blog post, and will return to them how many characters they have written and also how many characters they have remaining out of either 140 or 280 characters. The output must be like:

- *"You have written 182 characters, you have -42 characters left".*

### 2 - Write a code that creates a prompt, and when you paste in a large paragraph of text, then it should give you an alert that cuts your tweet down to only 140 characters.
